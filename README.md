# Aim of the project
The aim of the project is to plot the results of a pca analysis on a 2 dimensional graph along with the eigen values.

# How to run the code

## RStudio
Open the RStudio IDE and set the working directory to the same location of the `main.r` file. You can do it from the RStudio console with the command `setwd()`

``` r
setwd("path/to/main.r")
```

Alternatively, you can set the working directory from the RStudio GUI

## Visual Studio Code
Open the visual studio code editor and open the folder you saved the repository. If you want to use visual code to run R code, it's highly recommended to install the suggested `R` extensions to have a full visual code experience. To run the code, just click the "play" button on the top right of the window.
